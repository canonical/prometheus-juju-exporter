detection: # parameters affecting the detection algorithm
  match_interfaces: ''
  # Interface names that should be considered when detecting machine type.
  # Takes a single regexp string as input. Only interface names matching
  # the provided expression will be considered. The default value '' is
  # equivalent to '.*' and tells the detection algorithm to look through all interfaces.
  # Example: match_interfaces: ^(en[os]|eth)\d+|enp\d+s\d+|enx[0-9a-f]+
